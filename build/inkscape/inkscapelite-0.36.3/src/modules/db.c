	Basically this function just steps through the database.  The only

	the data into a structure on the stack, and then uses the internal
	function to demangle this.  By putting this data in the stack we

	provided by g_hash_table_foreach won't work out.

	\param     in_key    The key of the object being pulled out of the

	\param     in_value  The actual module (a pointer to it) that is
	                     located in the hash table.
	\param     in_data   A pointer to an array of pointers that is
	                     earlier in the stack.  It contains pointers
						 to the function we need to call, and the data
						 for it.

	The key purpose of this function is to take the rather obtuse
	prototype that is provided by the Glib hash table functions and
	turn it into something that is more natural by users of the moulde
	database.  Basically this moves the in_value parameter to the first
	parameter of the call.  It also grabs the function call and the data
	to be passed to it from a structure of two gpointers that is passed
	through the in_data parameter.  This structure is built in
	sp_module_db_foreach, but is not formally defined.
